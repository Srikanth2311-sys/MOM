### ❓ Why  
It helps for complex projects  
- Declarative code focuses only on describing what should change in the UI, rather than how — unlike imperative code which requires step-by-step instructions  
- Separation of concerns via components  
- OOPS concepts and principle [DI/classes]  
- Use TypeScript

### 🔄 Angular Evolution  
- Stable framework with strong **backward compatibility**

### 🚀 Creating a New Angular Project  
- You **cannot** create plain `.html` and `.js` files manually — Angular uses its own structure  
- Install Angular CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
- Create a new project:
  ```bash
  ng new first-app
  ```
